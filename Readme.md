# Requirements
- The latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This Fork's main aim is to make it as easy as possible to generate more than 1 bot at a time while keeping the overheads light. It is possible on the original bot but only by completely copying the original code into a separate container and running it. Though a relatively small repository, I wanted to challenge myself to make the bot utilize classes and instances of itself to give the user the option to run more than one with little input.
